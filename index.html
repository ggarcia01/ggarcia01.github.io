                    <p>
                        Hi! I’m Gilberto Garcia. 
                        I am a first-generation college graduate presently working as a post baccalaureate research assistant at Loyola University - Chicago’s Department of Physics. 
                        I currently live in Chicago, Ill, where I was born and raised. 
                        Previously, I lived in Middletown, CT for four years. 
                        During that time, I completed my undergraduate education at Wesleyan University, earning a degree in Astronomy and Physics and working as an Astronomy research assistant. 
                        With this experience, I am pursuing a career as an Astrophysicist. 
                        You can learn more about my research in my <a href="#research">research</a> page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of my background, I am deeply invested in STEM outreach and education, specifically working towards minimizing the education access gap and providing resources to underserved student populations.
                        Because of this, I have actively participated in STEM outreach programs and tutoring positions in Chicago and Middletown. 
                        To learn more about my work, you can take a look at my <a href="#CV">CV</a> page</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Outside of academics, I have enjoyed watching and playing soccer (or <em>football</em> if you are passionate about using the “proper” name), playing for school, club, and travel teams. 
                        To remain active, I enjoy long-distance running. 
                        I would love to run a half or full marathon some day. 
                        I am also interested in all-things cars, from repairing junk cars with my dad to talking about dream cars with friends.

                    <h1>Research</h1>
                    <h2>Undergraduate Research: Dramatic, Long-term X-ray Variability in AGN</h2>
                    <p>
                        Constraints on the duty cycle and duration of accretion episodes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are vital for establishing how most AGNs are fueled, which is essential for a complete picture of black hole/galaxy co-evolution. 
                        Perhaps the best handle we have on these activity parameters is provided by AGNs that have displayed dramatic, persistent changes in their bolometric luminosities. 
                        Given that X-ray emission is directly linked to black-hole accretion, X-ray source catalogs should provide a straightforward means of identifying AGNs that have undergone dramatic changes in their accretion states. 
                        However, it appears that such events are very rare, so observations separated in time by many years are needed to maximize discovery rates. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this project, we cross-correlated the Einstein IPC Two-Sigma Catalog with the Chandra Source Catalog to identify a sample of soft X-ray sources that varied by factors of at least 10 over timescales of 20 or more years. 
                        Most of the extremely variable sources revealed via this technique were dimmer in the Chandra era, owing to the lower sensitivity and modest exposures associated with Einstein. 
                        Optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey indicated that many of the variable sources were radio-quiet AGNs with broad emission lines — not "changing-look" objects that have more subtle AGN signatures in their spectra. 
                        We created long-term X-ray light curves for the sources by combining the Einstein and CSC fluxes with those obtained from serendipitous pointed observations by ROSAT.

                    <p>
                        This work resulted in an undergraduate thesis that was awarded high honors and was presented at various conferences.
                        You can find my thesis and my presentations in the bibliography and presentations section of my <a href="#CV">CV</a> page.

                        <p>
                            Below are some of my attempts to take pictures of celestial objects with my Samsung Galaxy S9. 
                            I would love to be able to learn proper astrophotography one day; it seems like a pretty expensive hobby though.
